this website is created by Mr Anish Raj Pandey as a school project 
there is a reason why this readme file looks so terrible and the reason is I suck at writing markdowns
I am just writing this markdown file so that i can practice touch typing and also I can make my contributions regular at my github profile
now i am done and i am deleting all of these now
